# Session 1: Python Print Statements & AI Code Completion

## Learning Objectives
- Master basic Python print statements
- Understand string formatting and variables
- Practice AI code completion techniques
- Build confidence with Python syntax

## Part 1: Basic Print Activities

### Activity 1.1: Hello World Variations
```python
# TODO: Complete these print statements
print("Hello, World!")
print("Hello, " + "Python!")
print("Welcome to", "Session 1")
# Your turn: Print your name and favorite color
```

### Activity 1.2: Variables and Print
```python
# TODO: Create variables and print them
name = "Your Name"
age = 15
favorite_language = "Python"

# Print using different methods
print(name)
print("My age is", age)
print(f"I love {favorite_language}")
```

### Activity 1.3: Multi-line Output
```python
# TODO: Create a formatted introduction
print("=" * 30)
print("Student Information")
print("=" * 30)
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Favorite Language: {favorite_language}")
print("=" * 30)
```

## Part 2: AI Code Completion Exercises

### Exercise 2.1: Pattern Recognition
```python
# AI Prompt: "Create a function that prints numbers 1 to 10"
# Let AI complete this pattern:
for i in range(1, 11):
    # AI will suggest: print(i)
```

### Exercise 2.2: String Manipulation
```python
# AI Prompt: "Create a greeting function with name parameter"
def greet_user(name):
    # Let AI complete the greeting logic
    # Expected: print(f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Python!")
```

### Exercise 2.3: Data Processing
```python
# AI Prompt: "Print student grades in a formatted way"
grades = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88]
# Let AI help format the output
# Expected: Loop through grades with formatting
```

## Instructions for Students

1. **Start with Basic Activities**: Complete Part 1 manually
2. **Use AI for Completion**: In Part 2, practice with AI code completion
3. **Experiment**: Try different prompts and see what AI suggests
4. **Understand the Output**: Don't just copy - understand what the code does
5. **Modify and Test**: Change variables and see how output changes

## AI Code Completion Tips

- Be specific in your prompts
- Start with simple, clear descriptions
- Use context comments to guide AI
- Test and modify AI suggestions
- Learn from the patterns AI creates

## Homework
1. Complete all activities in this session
2. Create 3 original print-based programs
3. Practice using AI completion for at least 5 different scenarios
4. Document what you learned about AI coding assistance
