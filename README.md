# The Mystic Codex: A Text-Based Adventure Game

## Excercise 1: Foundations & Conditions  
**Topic:** Using Conditions in the Game  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Create the basic game framework using if/elif/else statements  
- Implement player choice mechanics  
- Handle different story paths based on decisions  

### What Students Will Build:
- A simple story introduction where the player makes 2-3 critical choices  
- Each choice leads to different outcomes using conditional statements  
- Basic input validation (checking if player entered valid options)  
- Simple win/lose conditions  

### Key Activities:
- Write a story setup (player finds themselves in a mysterious location)  
- Create branching dialogue using if/elif/else  
- Implement choice validation (what happens if player enters invalid input)  
- Design at least 3 different story endings based on player choices  
- Add simple health/status tracking with conditional responses

## Excercise 2: Loops & Repetition  
**Topic:** Using Loops for Game Mechanics  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Implement game loops for continuous play  
- Use loops for repetitive actions (combat, exploration)  
- Create retry mechanisms and multiple attempts  

### What Students Will Build:
- Main game loop that keeps the game running until player quits  
- Combat system using while loops (player vs enemy with multiple rounds)  
- Exploration system where players can revisit locations  
- Retry mechanism for failed attempts (like solving puzzles)  

### Key Activities:
- Create a main menu that loops until player chooses to exit  
- Build a simple combat system with health points that continues until someone wins  
- Implement a puzzle-solving section where players get multiple attempts  
- Add a "play again" feature at the end of the game  
- Create an inventory collection system where players can gather items repeatedly

## Excercise 3: Functions & Code Organization  
**Topic:** Breaking Code into Reusable Functions  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Organize existing code into logical functions  
- Create reusable game mechanics  
- Implement function parameters and return values  

### What Students Will Build:
- Separate functions for different game actions (combat, exploration, dialogue)  
- Utility functions for common tasks (displaying health, validating input)  
- Story functions that can be called from different parts of the game  

### Key Activities:
- Refactor the combat system into a separate function  
- Create a function for displaying player status/inventory  
- Build functions for each major story section  
- Implement a function that handles all user input validation  
- Create utility functions for common game messages and formatting  
- Design functions that return different values based on game outcomes

## Excercise 4: Data Structures  
**Topic:** Arrays, Lists, and Dictionaries for Game Data  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Use lists to manage inventory and game items  
- Implement dictionaries for player stats and game state  
- Create arrays for storing multiple game elements  

### What Students Will Build:
- Player inventory system using lists  
- Character stats tracking with dictionaries  
- Multiple locations/rooms stored in data structures  
- Item database with properties and descriptions  

### Key Activities:
- Replace simple variables with a player stats dictionary (health, strength, items)  
- Create an inventory list that players can add/remove items from  
- Build a locations dictionary with room descriptions and available actions  
- Implement an items database with different item types and properties  
- Create lists of available actions for each game situation  
- Design a system to track multiple game states and progress

## Excercise 5: File Operations  
**Topic:** Reading and Writing Files for Persistence  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Save and load player progress  
- Implement high score tracking  
- Create game configuration files  

### What Students Will Build:
- Save/load system for player progress  
- High score leaderboard  
- Player profile system  
- Game settings storage  

### Key Activities:
- Implement save functionality that writes player stats to a file  
- Create a load function that restores previous game state  
- Build a high score system that tracks best performances  
- Design a player profile system with name and statistics  
- Create a settings file for game configuration (difficulty, sound preferences)  
- Implement error handling for file operations (what if save file is corrupted?)

## Excercise 6: Debugging & UI Transition  
**Topic:** Debugging and Adding Graphical Interface  

### Exercise Objectives:
- Debug and test the complete command-line version  
- Add error handling and user-friendly messages  
- Create a simple graphical interface using tkinter  
- Integrate both command-line and GUI versions  

### What Students Will Build:
- Comprehensive error handling for all game functions  
- A simple GUI version using tkinter with buttons for choices  
- A launcher that lets players choose between command-line or GUI mode  
- Final polished version with proper user feedback  

### Key Activities:
- Test all game functions and fix any bugs  
- Add try/except blocks for error handling  
- Create a simple tkinter window with buttons for major game actions  
- Implement the same game logic in GUI format  
- Build a main launcher that offers both play modes  
- Add proper error messages and user guidance  
- Create a final presentation/demo of the complete game
